# The School Rover - Campus Safety & Threat Prevention System

## Overview
**The School Rover** is a specialized security platform designed to protect students and staff through early threat detection, including weapons, drugs, and behavioral anomalies. Operating with a non-threatening, friendly appearance, it provides comprehensive security without creating a prison-like atmosphere.

## Critical Mission: Preventing School Violence

### Early Warning System
- **Weapon detection** before entry to buildings
- **Behavioral analysis** to identify distress/aggression
- **Chemical detection** for drugs and explosives
- **Social monitoring** for bullying and conflicts
- **Perimeter security** to detect unauthorized entry

### Key Design Principles
- **Non-threatening appearance** - Friendly, approachable design
- **Student privacy** - Protects dignity while ensuring safety
- **Rapid response** - Instant alerts to security and law enforcement
- **Evidence collection** - Document incidents for investigation
- **Integration** - Works with existing school security systems

## Multi-Layer Detection System

### Weapon Detection Technology

#### Concealed Weapon Detection
```python
class WeaponDetection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.detection_methods = {
            'metal_detection': FerrousSensor(),
            'shape_recognition': WeaponShapeAI(),
            'thermal_anomaly': ThermalImaging(),
            'millimeter_wave': MMWaveScanner(),
            'acoustic': GunshotDetector()
        }
    
    def scan_individual(self, person_id, distance):
        """Non-invasive weapon screening"""
        threat_level = 0
        alerts = []
        
        # Metal detection (guns, knives)
        metal_signature = self.detection_methods['metal_detection'].scan(person_id)
        if metal_signature.mass > WEAPON_THRESHOLD:
            threat_level += metal_signature.probability
            alerts.append({
                'type': 'metal_object',
                'size': metal_signature.mass,
                'location': metal_signature.position
            })
        
        # Shape recognition in bags/clothing
        shapes = self.detection_methods['shape_recognition'].analyze(person_id)
        for shape in shapes:
            if shape.matches_weapon_profile():
                threat_level += shape.confidence
                alerts.append({
                    'type': 'weapon_shape',
                    'category': shape.weapon_type,
                    'confidence': shape.confidence
                })
        
        # Thermal detection (concealed objects)
        thermal = self.detection_methods['thermal_anomaly'].scan(person_id)
        if thermal.concealed_mass_detected:
            threat_level += 0.3
            alerts.append({
                'type': 'concealed_object',
                'location': thermal.location
            })
        
        if threat_level > 0.5:
            self.trigger_weapon_alert(person_id, alerts, threat_level)
        
        return threat_level, alerts
```

            'unusual_clothing',  # Heavy coat in warm weather
            'nervous_behavior',
            'avoiding_security',
            'casing_behavior'  # Checking exits, cameras
        ]
    
    def analyze_individual(self, person):
        """Detect concerning behaviors"""
        behavior_score = 0
        concerns = []
        
        # Analyze gait and posture
        if self.detect_aggressive_walk(person.gait):
            behavior_score += 0.3
            concerns.append('aggressive_gait')
        
        # Check for concealment
        if self.detect_concealment(person.clothing, person.temperature):
            behavior_score += 0.4
            concerns.append('possible_concealment')
        
        # Analyze facial expression (stress, anger)
        emotion = self.analyze_emotion(person.face)
        if emotion in ['extreme_stress', 'rage', 'desperation']:
            behavior_score += 0.5
            concerns.append(f'emotional_state: {emotion}')
        
        # Check against baseline behavior
        if person.id in self.baseline_behaviors:
            deviation = self.calculate_deviation(person, self.baseline_behaviors[person.id])
            if deviation > CONCERN_THRESHOLD:
                behavior_score += 0.3
                concerns.append('significant_behavior_change')
        
        return behavior_score, concerns
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Entry Point Monitoring

- **During classes**: Detect unauthorized movement
- **Blind spots**: Cover areas without cameras
- **Stairwells**: Monitor isolated areas

### High-Risk Area Focus
- **Bathrooms**: Vaping and drug detection
- **Cafeteria**: Conflict monitoring
- **Gym/Locker rooms**: Bullying prevention
- **Library**: Quiet threat detection
- **Parking lots**: Vehicle inspection

            'directions': self.provide_directions,
            'schedule': self.show_bell_schedule,
            'emergency': self.emergency_help,
            'report_concern': self.anonymous_report
        }
    
    def interact_with_student(self, student):
        """Positive interaction while scanning"""
        # Perform security scan in background
        threat_level = self.background_scan(student)
        
        if threat_level < 0.3:  # No threat
            # Normal friendly interaction
            self.display_message(random.choice(self.greeting_messages))
            self.offer_help_menu()
        elif threat_level < 0.6:  # Possible concern
            # Gentle intervention
            self.display_message("Hey, everything okay? Need to talk to someone?")
            self.notify_counselor(student.id, 'student_may_need_support')
        else:  # High threat
            # Calm response while alerting security
            self.display_message("Please wait here for assistance")
