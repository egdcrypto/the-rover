    cell_size = 10;
    wall_thickness = 1.2;
    
    difference() {
        // Outer shell
        cube([length, width, height]);
        
        // Honeycomb cutouts
        for(x = [cell_size : cell_size*1.5 : length-cell_size]) {
            for(y = [cell_size : cell_size*sqrt(3) : width-cell_size]) {
                translate([x + (y/cell_size/sqrt(3))%2 * cell_size*0.75, y, -1])
                    cylinder(h=height+2, r=cell_size/2-wall_thickness, $fn=6);
            }
        }
    }
